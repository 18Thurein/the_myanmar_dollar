### What is The Myanmar Dollar?

The Myanmar Dollar (MYD) is a digital currency protocol based on Nano, but distributed only and evenly to Myanmar citizens. It is a digital payment protocol designed to be accessible and lightweight, with a focus on removing inefficiencies present in other cryptocurrencies. With ultrafast transactions and zero fees on a secure, green and decentralized network, this makes MYD ideal for everyday transactions.
